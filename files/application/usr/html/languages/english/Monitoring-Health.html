Monitoring Health

<h2>Introduction</h2>
If you do use NeDi's network monitoring features, this is the module to just leave open in a browser.
It'll refresh every minute to alert you (with original www.PSI.ch siren sounds!), if something went bad.
The size of the graphs can be set in User-Profile.
If you drill down into locations, the messages and events will be filtered accordingly. A mobile version without graphs and session management (no login required) can be accessed with mh.php.
Simply delete this file, if you don't want to allow this.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The top section displays overall network condition. Device availability, exceeded traffic, error or system thresholds (which are set in nedi.conf).
<li>The middle section takes care of events. Some statistic to the left and important events within the last 24h to the right.
<li>The bottom part works just like Topology-Map, while providing operational status of locations (monitored nodes and non-SNMP devices won't be shown). A shaded backgroun indicates that some devices are not monitored in a location.
</ul>
