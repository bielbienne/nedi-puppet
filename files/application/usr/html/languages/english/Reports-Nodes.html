Node Reports
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Reports focused around the computers connected to your network.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter on certain values, if desired (won't be taken into account for links to other modules).
<li>Select (hold down CTRL for multiple) reports you wish to look at.
<li>Adjust the limit to see more or less results.
<li>Check 'Alternative' to sort keys rather than values. You see the what's sorted on, on the bottom of each table.
</ul>

<h3>Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>Node statistics at a glance.
<li>Show duplicate node names (e.g. having a Wlan and Ethernet connection) or MAC addresses
<li>Interface statistics to detect hubs or virtual machines on and NeDi's internal metric statistics.
<li>Show top node OS and type statistics if nodes are fingerprinted with nmap 
<li>IP and IF changes multiplied yield NeDi's nomad factor, an indicator for those who seem to travel a lot.
<li>Node update hisory can reveal major changes or problems in your network. Each coloumn is limited individually (use filter to narrow down the timeframe)
<li>Empty vlans can be identified and eventually removed, if not needed on particular devices.
</ol>
