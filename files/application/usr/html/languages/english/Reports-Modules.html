Module Reports
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Need to know how many modules of a kind you've got? This report also helps, if you need to generate a HW inventory for support contracts based on serial numbers etc.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter on certain values, if desired (won't be taken into account for links to other modules).
<li>Select (hold down CTRL for multiple) reports you wish to look at.
<li>Adjust the limit to see more or less results.
<li>Check 'Alternative' to sort by model (in Summary) or device type (in Inventory) rather than values or device name.
</ul>


<h3>Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>Distribution presents an overview of which modules are installed in which devices.
<li>Inventory lets you generate a detailed list of devices and their individual modules.
<li>Print supplies and virtual machines are specific reports to reflect these items, which are stored in the DB as modules.
</ol>
