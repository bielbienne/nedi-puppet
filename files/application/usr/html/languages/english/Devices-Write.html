Devices Write
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div class="code warn">This is a very helpful, but also dangerous module!
Always use with caution, because you could create a big mess rather quickly...
</div>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Once you understand the filtering concept of Devices-List you should be able to pinpoint the group of devices you wish to access. (Note that only devices of the same operating system can be used at once).
<p>
Additionally you'll have to specify the desired commands. On IOS or similar devices you can use the Interface Configuration section (to the right) to generate ranges of commands.
<p>
<h4>Important!</h4>
<b>Click Show to verify your input before sending!</b>
<p>
You can simply Send Commands or use Configure to surround your commands with "conf t" and "end", "write mem" (or "sys" and "save" for Comware) on supported devices.
<p>
A newer feature is the "Condition B" subsitution mode, where you can substitute the matches (using 2nd text field) and use the result as argument for the command in "Commands" (only 1 command per device supported in this mode).<br>
Here's an Example:<br>
<ul>
<li>Let's say you moved all switches named SW01,02,03 etc. from the floor into a wallrack.
<li>Use ^SW as Condition A
<li>Enter something like "snmp-server location " (or whatever sets SNMP location on those switches) in the Execute/Config area.
<li>Select Location in Condition B and  enter "floor" in the left text field of Condition B and "wallrack" in the right one.
<li>Click Show and you should see each matched device with the command setting the new location.
<li>Click configure if it's correct.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Details</h2>
A couple pointers for the setup:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you adjust GUI authentication (towards the end of nedi.conf) to fit your needs.
<li>If you're unsure about it, delete html/inc/Devsend.pl to completely disable sending commands to devices!
</ul>
