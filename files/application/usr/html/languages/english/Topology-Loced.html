Location Editor

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Place your locations on the maps and add some comments if you want.
<h4>Important!</h4>
Only place locations in maps where it makes sense. For example, if you have a regional Map 
of Europe place Zurich in there but don't add buildings on that level. You should place 
buildings only in city maps and so forth...
<p>
Depending on whether you enabled Google Maps in User-Profile or not, this tool will act 
very differently:

<h2>Usage with Google Maps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upon selecting a location a geocode lockup is performed and the found coordinates are 
highlighted green in the NS & EW fields.
<li>A draggable marker is placed on the map, which can be adjusted to fit your needs. 
Enter a description and click the add button.
<li>The marker turns into an icon reflecting the respective location level and coordinates 
should stay black, since they're read from the DB now.
</ul>

<h2>Usage without Google Maps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Without Google Maps integration enabled jpeg backdrops can be edited. 
This can be leveraged with the geo map type in Topology-Maps.
<li>At first you'll see the top level map, which is a world map by default 
(I'll change this as soon as we've got networks on other celestial bodies).
<li>Select a region and click on the map to set the coordinates. You'll notice that values are being 
populated and the 'Add' button becomes 'Update', if the location already exists.
<li>Upload lower level maps to html/map with (System-Files for example). Let's say, your network sites 
are located in 2 regions (USA and Europe). Just name them map-USA.jpg and map-Europe.jpg and upload them. 
Now when you select cities in those regions, the appropriate map should be shown and you can place 
cities accordingly.
<li>This also works within cities (makes sense where you've got a big metropolitan network). Just upload a 
map-Europe-Zurich.jpg to html/map and as soon as you click on buildings in Zurich you can place them 
in that metropolitan map.
</ul>
