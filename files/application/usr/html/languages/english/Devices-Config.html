Devices Config
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Review and compare backed up configurations and their changes. Recent backup errors and config changes are shown by default.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>List</h3>
<ul>
<li>The left selectbox defines how the list should be filtered. You can limit (default 10) the number of listed configs with the limit 
selectbox to the right.
<li>Type the pattern into the text box or select a device from the selectbox to the right.
<li>Click on an excerpt (size can be set by limit by the limit selectbox to the left) from the list to view the actual configuration.
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks or use the notepad icon in the header to add it to the admin message (only appears when a list is actually shown).
<li>The last map can be included via paint icon and a limit (default 200) can be chosen as well. This can enhance any printouts which can be generated
with the print icon in the header. Click on the rows you may wish to highlight (double-click to remove) in the printout itself.
<li>You can export the list as XLS by clicking on the the list icon in the header (only appears when a list is actually shown).
<li>The resulting SQL query can be shown using the debug icon in the header (admin only). It links to Other-Export to generate CSV files or the likes.
<li>The triangles in the top row allow for the list to be sorted accordingly. They won't be available on special columns containing realtime data for example.
</ul>

<h3>Compare</h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose a reference device from the "List" selectbox. 
<li>Now either select the 2nd device from the left selectbox in "Comparison" or leave it at -Type- (This will list all configs of the same type).
Select how the output should be displayed.
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>
When viewing a config you've got the following options:

<li><img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png"> Clears configuration or changes.
</ul>
