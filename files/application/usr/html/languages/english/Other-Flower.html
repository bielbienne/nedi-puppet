Flower Openflows
</div>

<h2 class="warn">WARNING, this is still experimental!</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Openflow is a standard, which allows for a controller to directly manage flowtables on switches. This forms the foundation of Software
Defined Networking (SDN) and can be used to build firefwalls, loadbalancers and a lot more that we can't even think of, yet.
<p>
This module makes it easy to create and remove static flows on such an Openflow controller (right now Floodlight is supported and tested).

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set the name or IP address of your controller in the $flc variable at the top of the php code or simply call it with Other-Flower.php?flc=CONTROLLER
<li>All switches managed by the controller show up with their flows in a list on the bottom part.
<li>Hovering over icons and input fields reveal their purpose.
<li>If Flower is enabled in nedi.conf, you'll see its icon in Nodes-List's MAC and IP address fields, which lets you quickly add new flows based on them
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Pushing Flows</h3>
<ol>
<li>To push a new flow, enter a name for it and a priority if desired.
<li>Define the filter to match packets based on ingress port, source/dest MAC or IP address or UDP/TCP ports. You'll need to add 0x800 as Ethertype and 6 as
protocol, if you wish to match TCP packets for example.
<li>Now set an action to take, which can be a destination interface, vlan and even modifying MAC or IP address or port. If you don't specify an action, the 
matching packet will be dropped.
<li>Select the switches from the list below, where you want to install the flow on and click Add.
</ol>
