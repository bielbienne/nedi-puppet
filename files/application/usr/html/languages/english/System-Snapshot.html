System Snapshots

</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This modules lets you take a snapshot of the current database. This may be very helpful during a network migration for example.
It also lets you go back in time and find nodes or network topologies, which changed since...
<p>
In addition you could create a snapshot and import a NeDi database from a completely different network for review, without affecting your "real" data.

<h2>Adding</h2>
<ul>
<li> Type a suffix to identify your snapshot. By default a timestamp is filled in.
<li> Provide DB admin user (usually root) and password.
<li> Click add button to copy the current database to the snapshot (might take a while).
</ul>

<h2>Activating</h2>
<ul>
<li> The database used in the current session is indicated by <img src="../../img/16/walk.png">.
<li> Click on <img src="../../img/16/bcls.png"> in the snapshot list to activate either the main database or a snapshot.
<li> The <img src="../../img/nedi-n.png"> logo on the top left is replaced by <img src="../../img/16/foto.png" class="warn"> to remind you, that you're working in a snapshot now. Hover over it to reveal which one.
<li> Volume and rrdgraphs are turned off as well to avoid any confusion until you select the main database again (usually 'nedi').
<li> You can manipulate data in a snapshot, but it won't have an effect on the current database, since the discovery keeps using the main database.
</ul>

<h2>Deleting</h2>
<ul>
<li> Click on <img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png"> to delete a snapshot (only shown on inactive snapshots).
<li> After confirmation the snapshot will be deleted and its diskspace freed up.
</ul>
