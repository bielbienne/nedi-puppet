Combination Reports
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This module combines actual reports from the other reporting modules in order to provide more complete views across all data discovered by NeDi.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter on certain values, if desired (won't be taken into account for links to other modules).
<li>Select (hold down CTRL for multiple) reports you wish to look at.
<li>Adjust the limit to see more or less results.
<li>Check 'Alternative' to sort keys rather than values or absolute rather than relative values. You see the what's sorted on, on the bottom of each table.
<li>Check 'Optimize' for total instead of last counters or specify Ethernet interfaces on some reports. You see the what's used on, on the bottom of each table.
<li>Optionally include last map or top graphs.
</ul>

<h3>Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>Asset lists all device relevant info and the distribution of modules in them.
<li>Population shows how the nodes are distributed across your network.
<li>Monitoring summarizes events and incidents.
<li>Error lists duplicates that shouldn't be, IF errors/discards and link mismatches.
</ol>
