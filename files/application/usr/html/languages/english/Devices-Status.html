Devices Status
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is the centerpoint of individual device management. It's divided into 6 sections (General Info, Modules, 
Vlans, Links, Interfaces and Monitoring Stats), which correspond to the tables Devices, Modules, Vlans, Links and Interfaces. The 
monitoring part is shown on the bottom representing data from events, monitoring and incidents.
Except for interfaces those tables are limited to your Format setting in User-Profile, to avoid clutter. 
Hover over the icons for hints on what they do.
<p>
You'll see print supply levels on supported printers or VMs on VMware ESXis. If ssh access is enabled in addition, the VMs can be turned on and off.

<h4>Important!</h4>
Due to performance reasons, only uptime, poe, interface (and VM) operational status and interface 
last-change is realtime (if devices was seen in last discovery). Everthing else is retrieved from the database.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<img src="../../img/16/geom.png"> takes you straight to DefGen, in case you want to edit the definition file.<br>
<img src="../../img/16/bino.png"> adds the device to monitoring and tests SNMP uptime by default. This icons turns into
a clock in that case or another symbol, if you change the test method in Monitoring-Setup (click on icon to get there).
<p>
Click on its serial number to add it to your stock or update an existing item (e.g. to track decomissioned devices).
<p>
Node population is shown by checking <img src="../../img/16/nods.png">. The background turns blue if a node was ever 
discovered on it, even if it's empty now. The last seen MAC will be revealed upon hovering over it.
<p>
Graphs can be displayed with the interfaces by checking <img src="../../img/16/grph.png">. They're tiny unless you 
select large graphs in User-Profile. If unchecked the counter values are shown. If the absolute counter is not 0, 
the background is blue. Recent IF status changes, high IF errors or PoE values will be turn the background red(ish).
<b>The idea</b> behind all this is to show you which ports can be re-patched on a fully occupied switch. Chances are you won't get complaints if you unplug a port where:
<ol>
<li>No link (icon not green)
<li>IF last change is as much as switch uptime...or at least a long time ago! To be sure, you can also check the DB lastchange value in Devices-Interfaces.
<li>No nodes shown when Population is checked and field itself is not blue.
<li>Traffic is 0 and field is not blue.
</ol>
<p>
If SNMP write access is discovered you can change location, contact, IF adminstatus directly. If the device is using standard MIBs you may also edit IF-alias (enter a "-" to clear) and toggle PoE 
delivery (e.g. to reset a hanging AP or VoIP phone). On devices not updating the config automatically, you can click on <img src="../../img/16/wrte.png"> to do so, if CLI
access is provided.
<p>
Active interfaces' names are blue and clicking on it pops up a realtime SVG graph window, which lets you observe the traffic in a 1 - 300 second interval.
<p>
You can modify log/devtools.php in System-Files to include links to other parts of NeDi (e.g. Managed AP list of Wlan controllers) or external tools.
