Devices Interfaces
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
List interfaces and their graphs. This module lets you find port descriptions or compare duplex, speed or traffic etc.

<h2>Usage</h2>
List device interfaces by pressing the "Show" button. Use the "Columns" select box to add or remove the columns (hold down CTRL for multiple) you wish to see.

The following filter methods are available to narrow down your search:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>Alternatively you can compare 2 columns directly by using a combination with "col" (To find devices where firstseen equals lastseen for example).
</ol>

General Notes:
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks or use the notepad icon in the header to add it to the admin message.
<li>The last map can be included via paint icon and a limit (default 200) can be chosen as well. This can enhance any printouts which can be generated
with the print icon in the header. Click on the rows you may wish to highlight (double-click to remove) in the printout itself.
<li>You can export the list as XLS by clicking on the the list icon in the header.
<li>The resulting SQL query can be shown using the debug icon in the header (admin only). It links to Other-Export to generate CSV files or the likes.
<li>The triangles in the top row allow for the list to be sorted accordingly. They won't be available on special columns containing realtime data for example.
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the interface status is discovered, the type icon is imbued with the respective color (not realtime). It'll always be red (admin down), if it's skipped.
<li>Click Track if you wish to track changes on those interfaces in Node-Track
<li><img src="../../img/16/sys.png"> takes you to Device-Status.
<li>The population takes you to the Nodes-List where you get detailed information on the connected nodes.
<li>The graphs are tiny unless you select large graphs in User-Profile.

</ul>
