Monitoring Master
</div>

<h2 class="warn">WARNING, this is still experimental!</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The master console should be used on a central NeDi host, where only the master.pl daemon is running. All other GUI modules except Devices-List, Devices-Status, Reports-Monitoring and Monitoring-Events should be disabled
to avoid confusion. In addition a unique theme should be selected to further distinguish this host from regular NeDi installations.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add remote NeDi installations to the agentlist and add the usernames and passwords to access them in nedi.conf
<li>Run master.pl from System-Services (only appears there if Monitoring-Master is enabled in nedi.conf)
<li>Go to Devices-List and add detected agents to monitoring (NeDi agents are treated as devices)
<li>Go to Monitoring-Setup and select http or https to tell master.pl how to access the agents
<li>Go back to System-Services to restart master.pl or wait for a 'pause' intervall to get the agents polled
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upon first access, master.pl reads the last event with level 200 (alert) or above and all unacknowledged incidents.
<li>On subsequent runs only new alert-events are read. Incidents are removed from the master console, if they're acknowledged on the agent.
<li>Monitoring-Master shows those events and incidents with quick links to the respective agents.
</ul>
