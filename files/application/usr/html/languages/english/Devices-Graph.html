<h2>Introduction</h2>
The heart of your graphing pleasures allows you to dynamically generate stacked interface graphs on the fly and much more.
<h4>Important!</h4>
Please note that NeDi's graphing feature was implemented as an addition with lowest possible resource and maintenance cost in mind. 
It will not graph those 5 minute peaks (unless you run NeDi every 5 minutes in very small networks), but provide a longterm view 
on each and every interface (or system stats) based on your discovery schedule. This translates to baselining and prediction of potential 
bottlenecks, instead of identifying erratic outbursts of any kind (You'd prefer using a tool like Cacti to monitor this stuff instead).

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select any top graphs if you wish to get the big picture on your network.
<li>Selecting a device will reveal its interfaces. You can choose several of them to be stacked dynamically (doesn't work for IF status!).
<li>Select several graph sources at once to correlate and investigate problems (e.g. CPU load, broadcasts on some interfaces of a device)
<li>System related graphs are CPU, Memory and Temperature and a custom graph for other values.
<li>Use double arrows to move start (top one), the whole graph (middle) or its end (bottom one) by weeks or single arrows for days. Click 
on a date icon to manually set a start or end time.
<li>If you can't live without degrees Fahrenheit, check it in User-Profile.
<li>If you use Cacti on the same host, set $cacticli in html/inc/libmisc.php to easily add graphs...
</ul>
