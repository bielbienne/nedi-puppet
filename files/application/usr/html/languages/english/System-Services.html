System Service
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
View processes and resources of your NeDi host and start or stop certain services. 

<h2>Usage</h2>
Click on <img src="../../img/16/walk.png"> to stop or <img src="../../img/16/bcls.png"> start the given service.
<p>
This only works, if the services don't need to open any priviledged ports (< 1024). Of course you could run the webserver as root, but that can
create security risks! Therefore NeDi's Syslog (syslog.pl) and snmptrapd run on high-ports and usually are redirected by an internal firewall.

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Top part shows and controls NeDi related services.
<li>Lower part shows all running processes and some system stats.

<h3>Threads</h3>
Depending on the size and topology of your network, it makes sense to
run several discoveries at the same time. Do this by dividing the network
in a few sections using borders and different seedfiles. Then adapt your
crontab accordingly.
<p>
At the end of a run the nodes table needs to be locked during calculation, 
with that no other thread meddles with them. Furthermore should Top RRDs only
be taken care of by the last thread to finish or they're gonna look like Picassoes.
<p>
On the far right you see the discovery status (# of threads is revealed by hovering over <img src="../../img/16/walk.png">. If the nodes table is locked a <img src="../../img/16/lokc.png"> is shown next to it.
	 
In case a discovery terminated unexpectedly or a nodelock hangs, you can reset it
by clicking on <img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png">.
